    "text": "In universities and colleges throughout the world, student enrollment has increased drastically over time, as secondary institutions and mass media encourage students to acquire higher education to benefit themselves and their career. Although numbers in enrollment have increased, so have the dropout rates in these same institutions. However, researchers have strived to prevent a student’s likelihood of dropping out of college and increase their potential academic success. The dataset I retrieved was from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, and was created by Valentim Realinho, Mónica Vieira Martins, Jorge Machado, and Luís Baptista. The data was collected from students going to college in the country of Portugal. The question that I am seeking to answer is: Which factors are most predictive of a student’s likelihood to drop out? My hypothesis is that financial constraints may be a substantial factor in why students dropout of college.\nLink to data: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/697/predict+students+dropout+and+academic+success\n\n\n\nAs mentioned previously, the data that was collected, analyzed and stored into the dataset that I used for this project came from a student population in the country of Portugal. As in every case, there can be missing data. One important thing to note is that this data provides limitations, as the data collection only considers college students from one country, Portugal, and does not include other countries such as the United States or Canada. This data may or may not accurately represent the factors influencing college drop-out rates and academic success for every college student population. As a result, it is important to not assume a general stance based on this data, but rather a collective understanding of what motivates students to achieve different paths.\nMoving forward, the sample that the researchers and data analysts provided come from a handful of college students residing in Portgual. Here, researchers collected data from students studying various academic disciplines and fields, such as nursing, journalism and management. It is also important to note that the researchers recorded the demographic of the participants, storing information such as age, gender, and marital status in their dataset. They decided to do so in order to know what the student’s current information was during the time of enrollment and how this contributed to their performance in their individual classes. The total number of participants the researchers found was 4424 students, and there are 36 variables, or features, that they recorded. The kind of data the variables contain are integer, categorical and real data. After the semester was over in the time that the researchers were doing the study, the participants were organized into three categories: dropout, enrolled, and graduate. The purpose of this study was to find ways to reduce the number of students failing or dropping out of higher education. In doing this, the researchers can predict which students are at high risk of the aforementioned actions, and be able to support them.\nI will be analyzing this dataset through the programming language Python, which is used in my Jupyter notebook. I will first observe and clean the data, if necessary, to ensure that the data is being correctly analyzed with its intended purpose. Then, I hope to create data visualizations that explore the demographics of the student population. I also plan to create other data visualizations that analyze any key factors that may contribute to a student’s likelihood of dropping out. Lastly, I will summarize the results I find through this analysis and provide insight as to why this dataset is useful for future students and research.\n\n\n\nThe following visualizations are an exploration of the dataset. Here, I lay out a few key variables that showcase the demographics of the population, as well as an overview of what the variables are and how they were recorded for each individual student.\n\n\n\n# Import every package needed\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\n\n## pip install ucimlrepo in TERMINAL\n\n## Code obtained from website starts here\nfrom ucimlrepo import fetch_ucirepo \n  \n# fetch dataset \npredict_students_dropout_and_academic_success = fetch_ucirepo(id=697) \n  \n# data (as pandas dataframes) \nX = predict_students_dropout_and_academic_success.data.features \ny = predict_students_dropout_and_academic_success.data.targets \n\n## Code obtained from website ends here\n\ndf_col_merged = pd.concat([X, y], axis=1)\n\n## The target variable, which consists of the status of each student in terms of \n## enrollment, dropout or graduated, was separated from the main dataframe,\n## so I had to merge them to get a total of 37 columns.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Stacked Bar graph for Course and Target variables\ndf_col_merged['Course'] = df_col_merged['Course'].map(course_mapping)\n\npivot_table = df_col_merged.pivot_table(index='Course', columns='Target', aggfunc='size', fill_value=0)\npivot_table.plot(kind='barh', stacked=True)\n\n# Add labels and title\nplt.xlabel('Number of Students')\nplt.ylabel('Course')\nplt.title('Distribution of Students by Course and Enrollment Status')\nplt.legend(title='Target')\nplt.figtext(0.5, -0.1, \"Figure 5.

Notably, there appears to be a higher dropout rate in STEM-related fields of study.\n\n## Plot for Tuition fees up to date variable and Target variable\nfees_mapping = {0: \"no\", 1: \"yes\"}\n\ndf_col_merged['Tuition fees up to date'] = df_col_merged['Tuition fees up to date'].map(fees_mapping)\n\npivot_table = df_col_merged.pivot_table(index='Tuition fees up to date', columns='Target', aggfunc='size', fill_value=0)\npivot_table.plot(kind='bar', stacked = True)\n\n# Add labels and title\nplt.xlabel('Tuition fees up to date')\nplt.ylabel('Number of Students')\nplt.title('Student Enrollment and Tuition Payment Status')\nplt.legend(title='Target')\nplt.figtext(0.5, -0.1, \"Figure 6.

We can contrast this with the students who have paid their fees and have also graduated or are still enrolled. The majority of students who have not paid their tuition have dropped out, while the majority of students who have paid their tuition have either graduated or are still enrolled at their college.\n\n## Plot for Debtor variable and Target variable\ndebtor_mapping = {0: \"no\", 1: \"yes\"}\n\ndf_col_merged['Debtor'] = df_col_merged['Debtor'].map(displaced_mapping)\n\npivot_table = df_col_merged.pivot_table(index='Debtor', columns='Target', aggfunc='size', fill_value=0)\npivot_table.plot(kind='bar', stacked = True)\n\n# Add labels and title\nplt.xlabel('Student Debt Status')\nplt.ylabel('Number of Students')\nplt.title('Distribution of Students by Debt Status')\nplt.legend(title='Target')\nplt.figtext(0.5, -0.1, \"Figure 7.

However, among those who do have debt, a significant portion has dropped out, suggesting that financial difficulties may contribute to the decision to not complete college.\n\n## Plot for Scholarship holder variable and Target variable\nn_mapping = {0: \"no\", 1: \"yes\"}\n\ndf_col_merged['Scholarship holder'] = df_col_merged['Scholarship holder'].map(n_mapping)\n\npivot_table = df_col_merged.pivot_table(index='Scholarship holder', columns='Target', aggfunc='size', fill_value=0)\npivot_table.plot(kind='bar', stacked = True)\n\n# Add labels and title\nplt.xlabel('Scholarship Holder Status')\nplt.ylabel('Number of Students')\nplt.title('Distribution of Students by Scholarship Status')\nplt.legend(title='Target')\nplt.figtext(0.5, -0.1, \"Figure 8. Student Scholarship Holders Illustrated in Stacked Bar Chart\", ha='center', va='center', fontsize=12, color='black')\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs shown in Figure 8, there are notable differences between students who hold a scholarship and those who do not. Among scholarship holders, most students have either graduated or are still enrolled in college. Conversely, a significant proportion of students without scholarships have dropped out. This disparity may indicate that financial support plays a crucial role in student retention and maintaining enrollment at college.\n\n\n\n\nWhat my data analysis shows is how one factor may influence a student’s possibility of dropping out of college. First, I examined a few key demographic variables that showcase who exactly the student population is, such as what field of study they are interested in, their age, and marital status, shown in Figures 1, 2, 3 and 4. These variables give us detailed information about the college student population that was recorded throughout the dataset. Then, I started looking at any possible relationships between the variables listed in the dataset with the Target variable, a variable that consisted of three categories: Enrolled, Dropout and Graduate. Overall, there are a total of three potential factors that might explain the dropout rate within this population.\nThe first variable that I looked at was the classes each student took during the semester that this study was conducted in. The variable Course had a total of 17 categories, or in this case, field of study that the students were enrolled in. As shown in Figure 5, there are varying levels of students in each category in each individual area of study. For example, we can see that, of the approximately 400 students enrolled in management classes, about 150 students dropped out, about 250 students are still currently enrolled, and about 400 students have graduated by the end of the semester. These ratios are similar in most of the other areas of study, where roughly 30% of all students in their respective field of study drop out. It is unknown why these students drop out, either due to the curriculum of the field or the rigor that may be too much for them. Regardless, there is no indication that the area of study is heavily involved in student dropout rate since each field has roughly the same percentage.\nNext, I started looking at variables that were finance related, such as scholarships, debt and tuition fees. First, I looked at the relationship between a student’s enrollment and whether or not they were able to pay their tuition and fees. By creating a stacked bar graph (Figure 6), I observed that, although a majority of students have paid their fees, a substantial number of students have not. From the group that has not, I observed that a large portion of the students have dropped out. This may be as a result of being unable to pay their fees on time. Another variable that I considered debt. It is unknown where the source of this debt comes from, or the amount of debt an individual is in, but researchers have recorded students and whether they had debt or not. As shown in Figure 7, although a large portion of students do not have debt, a significant portion do. In the “yes” bar, a substantial number of students who have dropped out are present, indicating that acquiring too much debt can put students at a disadvantage and force them to drop out. A final variable that I analyzed was called “Scholarship holder,” where researchers asked students if they currently hold a scholarship that could potentially pay for portions of their tuition and other expenses. Shown in Figure 8, the majority of students in this population did not hold a scholarship at the time this study was conducted. Of the ones that did, only a small portion dropped out, whereas a considerable portion of students who did drop out had no scholarship at all. This may indicate that scholarships are one way in reducing dropout rates in college student populations, as they provide an incentive and gracious opportunity for them to continue their studies and education.\nThe overall big picture here is that money is an important factor to consider when observing the reasoning behind dropout rates in college students. For many students, money is an important part of their lives, and attending college is known to be a costly investment. If students are not able to pay their tuition, whether it is due to lack of money management, scholarships, or other reasons, then students would be forced to either take out loans, which could put them in an even worse position than before, or unenroll in their institution. Factors such as debt status, scholarship status and tuition paid status are important in knowing if a student will stay enrolled or not in college. This data is useful because it provides evidence that programs for scholarships and government aid are important for students that come from low income families and need the money to help pay for college. It also provides insight as to how future research can be done to prevent student dropout rates from increasing and find methods that work in combating the problems associated with college dropouts.\n\n\n\nM.V.Martins, D.
